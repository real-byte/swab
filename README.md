## Overview

SWAB (Spyxpo Web to App Builder) is a Flask-based tool that transforms websites into native applications using Flutter's WebView capabilities. It provides a modern web interface for configuring app settings and building platform-specific executables without writing any code.

> **Note:** This is a preview build for testing purposes. A major update is coming soon.
